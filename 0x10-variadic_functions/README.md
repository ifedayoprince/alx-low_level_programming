# C - Variadic functions

In this project, I learned about using variadic functions , `va_start`,
`va_arg`, and `va_end` macros as well as why and how to use the `const` type qualifier in C.

## Header File :file_folder:

* [variadic_functions.h](./variadic_functions.h): Header file containing definitions and
prototypes for all types and functions written in the project.

## Tasks :page_with_curl:
