# C - Function pointers

In this project, I learned about function pointers in C - what they hold,
where they point in virtual memory, and how to use them.

## Header Files :file_folder:

* [function_pointers.h](./function_pointers.h): Header file containing prototypes
for all functions written for programs 0-2 of the project.

* [3-calc.h](./3-calc.h): Header file containing definitions and prototypes for all
types and function written for the program [3-main.c](./3-main.c).

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0. What's my name**

* **1. If you spend too much time thinking about a thing, you'll never get it done**

* **2. To hell with circumstances; I create opportunities**

* **3. A goal is not always meant to be reached, it often serves simply as something to aim at**

* **4. Most hackers are young because young people tend to be adaptable. As long as you remain adaptable, you can always be a good hacker**
