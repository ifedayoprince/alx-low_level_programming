For this project, we expect you to look at this concept:

C programming

Resources
Read or watch:

“C” Programming Language: Brian Kernighan
Why C Programming Is Awesome
Learning to program in C part 1
Learning to program in C part 2
Understanding C program Compilation Process

Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

General
Why C programming is awesome
Who invented C
Who are Dennis Ritchie, Brian Kernighan and Linus Torvalds
What happens when you type gcc main.c
What is an entry point
What is main
How to print text using printf, puts and putchar
How to get the size of a specific type using the unary operator sizeof
How to compile using gcc
What is the default program name when compiling with gcc
What is the official C coding style and how to check your code with betty-style
How to find the right header to include in your source code when using a standard library function
How does the main function influence the return value of the program
Copyright - Plagiarism
You are tasked to come up with solutions for the tasks below yourself to meet with the above learning objectives.
You will not be able to meet the objectives of this or any following project by copying and pasting someone else’s work.
You are not allowed to publish any content of this project.
Any form of plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.
Requirements
C
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
All your files should end with a new line
A README.md file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of this project, containing a description of the project
There should be no errors and no warnings during compilation
You are not allowed to use system
Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
Shell Scripts
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
All your scripts should be exactly two lines long ($ wc -l file should print 2)
All your files should end with a new line
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/bin/bash
More Info
Betty linter
To run the Betty linter just with command betty <filename>:

Go to the Betty repository
Clone the repo to your local machine
cd into the Betty directory
Install the linter with sudo ./install.sh
emacs or vi a new file called betty, and copy the script below:
#!/bin/bash
# Simply a wrapper script to keep you from having to use betty-style
# and betty-doc separately on every item.
# Originally by Tim Britton (@wintermanc3r), multiargument added by
# Larry Madeo (@hillmonkey)

BIN_PATH="/usr/local/bin"
BETTY_STYLE="betty-style"
BETTY_DOC="betty-doc"

if [ "$#" = "0" ]; then
    echo "No arguments passed."
    exit 1
fi

for argument in "$@" ; do
    echo -e "\n========== $argument =========="
    ${BIN_PATH}/${BETTY_STYLE} "$argument"
    ${BIN_PATH}/${BETTY_DOC} "$argument"
done
Once saved, exit file and change permissions to apply to all users with chmod a+x betty
Move the betty file into /bin/ directory or somewhere else in your $PATH with sudo mv betty /bin/
You can now type betty <filename> to run the Betty linter!
