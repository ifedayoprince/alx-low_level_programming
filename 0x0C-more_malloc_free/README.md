# C - More malloc, free

In this project, I learned about using `exit`, `calloc`, and `realloc` in C.

## Tests :heavy_check_mark:

* [tests](./tests): Folder of test files. Provided by Holberton School.

## Header File :file_folder:

* [main.h](./main.h): Header file containing prototypes for all functions written in
the project.


## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0. Trust no one**

* **1. string_nconcat**

* **2. _calloc**

* **3. array_range**

* **4. _realloc**

* **5. We must accept finite disappointment, but never lose infinite hope**
